		<h1>2/24/2016 - Checkpoint</h1>
		<p>I have already implemented most of the basic game logic needed for the core of Minesweeper.<br />
		A few things still remain, like disabling the player from revealing more tiles when the game is over,<br />
		and recognizing that all the bombs have been flagged to celebrate the player's victory.</p>
		<p>Seeing that I'm only half-way through the semester, I plan on implementing additional game logic <br />
		which will add to the player's experience of the game. Such game logics will include, but no be limited to, <br />
		keeping score, add a player wallet and a store; buy booster items, for example a radar to flag all mines in a <br />
		3x3 or 5x5 radius of the user's click, bomb defuser's suit to let player survive a bomb or two, etc.</p>
		<h2>Main Game Logic Components</h2>
		<ul>
			<h4>Implemented</h4>
			<li><strong>Generate Grid</strong> - Randomly assign bombs, and assign correct numbers to adjacent tiles.<br />
			To test, comment out line 189 in View.js, and uncomment line 190, then start new games to see an uncovered map.</li>
			<li><strong>Generate Map</strong> - Display the player's unexplored view of the map. Available in <em>Classic</em> and <em>Grassy</em>.<br />
			To test, just choose your difficulty and tile type, then press "Start New Game!"</li>
			<li><strong>Destroy Map</strong> - Deletes all information about previous map. Ensures good memory management, and prevents bugs.</li>
			<li><strong>Event Handlers</strong> - Listens for player mouse clicks, and adds functionality to vital buttons (e.g. start new game!)<br />
			To test, left-click on any in-game tile to reveal it, or right-click on a tile to flag it, also notice that the context menu doesn't appear on the map.</li>
			<li><strong>Flag Tiles</strong> - Involves the player right-clicking on any given tile to flag it.</li>			
			<li><strong>Explore Tile</strong> - Involves player left-clicking an unexplored tile to reveal it's contents.</li>
			<li><strong>Explore Empty Tile</strong> - recursively opens all adjacent tiles until the empty tiles are surrounded by numbers.<br />
			To test, simply start a new game, and reveal tiles until you find an "empty" tile which will trigger this game logic.</li>
			<li><strong>Interface functions</strong> - Added to View for communicating with the Model. More might be added as needed.</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<h4>Not Implemented</h4>
			<li><strong>Detect Success</strong> - Celebrate player's victory (later add money to wallet, increase score count, etc.)</li>
			<li><strong>Detect Failure</strong> - Lament player's near death experience (later take money from wallet, increase death count, etc.)</li>
			<li><strong>Disable Map Clicks</strong> - Once the player wins, the map needs to disable any event listeners until a new game has started.</li>
			<li><strong>First Click is Empty</strong> - A player's first click should always be on an empty tile.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Optional Game Logic Components</h2>
		<ul>
			<h4>Implemented</h4>
			<li><strong>Animated explosion</strong> - When you step on a mine, let it do what it does best: Explode!<br />
			To test, accidentally of purposefully click on a mine to witness the explosion up close!</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<h4>Not Implemented</h4>
			<li><strong>M.I.N.E. Shop</strong> - Capitalism rules! Buy your way to success with better equipment. (disposible items.)</li>
			<li><strong>Player Wallet</strong> - Capitalism rules! Money looks like success, it smells like success, and it tastes like success.</li>
			<li><strong>Player Statistics</strong> - Keep track of wins and losses for each map type, timed records for each map, total money earned/spent, etc.</li>
			<li><strong>Timer</strong> - The bomb defusing training taught you patience, but your inner child wants to see how quickly you can do it!</li>
			<li><strong>Customized Map</strong> - Let the player set the width, height, and mines themselves.</li>
			<li><strong>Mass Explosion</strong> - When you step on a mine, it will trigger all other unflagged mines to explode.</li>
		</ul>
